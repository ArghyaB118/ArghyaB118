- 👋 Hi, I’m Arghya Bhattacharya.
- 🕴️ I am a doctoral candidate in computer science in the fourth year of my graduate studies at Stony Brook University, New York, 🇺🇸.
- 🧑‍🎓 I did my undergraduate in electrical engineering at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, 🇮🇳.
- 🧑‍🔬 I am interested in algorithms, data structures, machine learning, and probability.
- 👀 More precisely, I study 
    * cache-efficient external-memory algorithms, 
    * parallel (multi-threaded) algorithms, 
    * machine-learning augmented online algorithms, 
    * filesystem aging.
- 👨‍💻 My coding skills include C++, Python, Matlab, Shell, MySQL, and Keras.
- 🤵 I am actively looking for internship positions in applied sciences for Summer’22, specifically, in the field of software engineering, machine learning, and data science.
- 📫 Reach me anytime with interesting ideas. Drop a mail at argbhattacha@cs.stonybrook.edu
